"American radio non-commissioned officer, member of an allied team, volunteer for missions in occupied territory, in liaison with the Resistance, parachuted on August 15, 1944, in the Aisne.
Putting on civilian clothes to avoid being captured by the enemy who was tightly controlling the region, he was able to ensure, under extremely difficult conditions, regular contact with the Headquarters of the French Forces of the Interior in LONDON, thus providing the most valuable intelligence on enemy positions in the region.
On August 28, he crossed the German lines to contact the allied troops and provide them with important intelligence, then on August 30, wishing to continue his work, he attempted to cross enemy lines again but he was caught in an ambush and immediately shot on the spot.
Sergeant COTE showed the greatest bravery and total dedication in the accomplishment of his mission in all circumstances."
