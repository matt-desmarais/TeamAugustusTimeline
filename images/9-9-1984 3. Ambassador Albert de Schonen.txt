ID But the unpredictable German machine was at the crossroads. What a 
drama unfolded between these three men, unarmed, nothing but men of flesh 
and blood, and this blind, deadly, explosive steel monster. Yes, what a 
colossal drama between these three men enamored of liberty and this 
mammoth thirsting for destruction as much as for domination. Ah, if they 
could have sent a final message, I presume they would have appealed to the 
loyalty of the living: to their comrades Khurch, to the Resistance 
fighters they had just left, to the members of their squads, so close for 
Delviche, so far for Bonball and Cotr. All were present in their minds 
like a true honor guard before a firing squad, just as today before this 
grave and this memorial plaque, you are the living testament to their 
memory, made of so much courage, nobility, and beauty. Their first burial 
was under the starry night, and the silence echoed the song of the heroes 
of our history who welcomed them into eternity. Let us not forget that 
Elviche wore a medal around his neck affirming his Catholic faith, and it 
can be said that these men, lost on the road, abandoned, purifying the 
earth with their blood, were never again taken from the land. For 40 
years, you, citizens of Rafeeton, have kept the living memory of these 
heroes alive in your hearts. What consolation for Elviche's mother, now 
far away due to age, and for his sister, who lives nearby! You felt that 
the shared destiny of these Prangians and these two Americans constituted 
a new page in the history of our humanity. But as the years pass, hearts 
cease to beat, and veterans' associations, especially the Association of 
Resistance Medal Recipients, with the support of the municipal 
authorities, felt that the time had come to inscribe the name of Nov 
Ovtagad in marble. A marble plaque is not merely a tribute; it speaks to 
the passerby. On this land of the Aisne, so often scarred by invasions, 
who could pass here without reflecting, without giving in to thought, 
prayer, contemplation, without emptying their mind to better understand 
the true value of life? But I would like—and in this I am convinced I am 
interpreting the thoughts of my comrades—I would like this plaque to evoke 
not only an Arame, but more the faces of three young men enamored of 
freedom and the joy of living. During these 6 months of communal living in 
ENGLAND we saw them happy and they would tell young people today to live 
intensely, to do Hoover Institution Stanford, California 94305-6003 USA
