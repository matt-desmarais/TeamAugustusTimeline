The OSS Memorial stands in the lobby of the CIA’s Original Headquarters Building as a tribute to the 116 members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) who died during World War II. 
Physically, the memorial features a single star carved into the wall, an inscription honoring those who “gave their lives in the service of their country,” and beneath it a “Book of Honor” displayed in a glass-encased marble pedestal listing the names of the fallen.
