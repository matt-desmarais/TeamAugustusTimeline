light, to have the fury of life because life is not a routine but a 
perpetual creation of the world. This joy of living was not incompatible 
with their volunteerism, which implied total sacrifice, even to the point 
of greatness. BONSALL, DELVICHE, and COTE had linked their fates to defend 
liberty, and it is in the name of liberty that they were so brave. Liberty 
needs men of character, and it is heartening to see that thousands of men 
like DELVICHE refused capitulation and raised, as soon as they could, the 
flag that was abandoned in 1940. I am therefore confident that this plaque 
will not only evoke an episode of the past but that it will mark a 
glorious page in the history of FRANCE and our American and British 
allies. Inhabitants of Barenton You are the custodians of a portion of 
this remembrance, and I cannot fail to say:

LONG LIVE BARENTON SUR SERRE!
LONG LIVE THE JEDBURGHS!
LONG LIVE FRANCE!
