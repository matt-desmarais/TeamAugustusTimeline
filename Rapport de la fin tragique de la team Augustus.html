Report
on the tragic end of the airborne mission Augustus
<br><br>
This mission, composed of three men: one French captain, Jean Delviche, one American major (name not stated here), and one American radio noncommissioned officer, Roger Cote, was parachuted on 16 August onto the field "Fable" of the BOA North Zone, where they worked in close collaboration until 28 August 1944.
<br><br>
After having operated a few days with the section chief, they moved to the region of Braine, at Mr. Mathieu's farm in Augy-Saint-Herem (spelling uncertain), where they were lodged from 24 to 28 August inclusive. Security was assured by the team of the Zone chief, 185th Company ("Black Forest").
<br><br>
The rapid Allied advance led Captain Augustus to go north again in order to complete his mission to the end, but the friend who was transporting them to Braine came upon an American armored column, so they had to turn back. During this difficult trip, the mission, having identified themselves, proposed to continue their goal by gathering information from a leader who had losses in his lines, and went toward Courton, Braine Caves. They were welcomed at Hugny by Mr. Mathieu, where they stayed from 24 to 28 August. Security was assured by the team of the Zone chief, 185th Company (Black Forest). (This paragraph appears duplicated in the original.)
<br><br>
The Allies were already in Laon. The men of Augustus traveled there in an American vehicle.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
On 29 August they returned to the lodging of Mr. Maquet, a farmer well known to Captain Delviche, and asked for a vehicle to pass the lines. They ate dinner and around 21:30 left in a German horse-drawn vehicle (this vehicle had been left behind by the Germans).
<br><br>
Mr. Maquet accompanied them in order to show them the way, because Captain Augustus wished to avoid the main roads. Around 21:30 they left, and the mission was to go to Mr. Maquet's son-in-law at Barenton-sur-Serre. What happened afterwards?
<br><br>
Around 22:45 it began to rain, a torrential rain, making visibility almost zero in the night, and producing worrying noises.
<br><br>
Upon arriving on the main road to Barenton, they were probably stopped by German soldiers. Others searched the vehicle. The driver was found dead near the fuel tank. Around 23:00 the men inside still appeared to be present. The two officers (1 and 2) were side by side, arms raised. The radio operator (3) was found about twelve meters away, face to the ground (having probably tried to escape). They all bore large wounds to the head. Everything occurred around 23:45.
<br><br>
According to the first information, they must have tried to get out of the vehicle, but in the violence he (the radio operator) had gone too far away.
<br><br>
It was by pure chance and thanks to Mr. Maquet, who informed the team of N. Seigneret, that we were able to find the trace of Mission Augustus and thus pay homage to those men who deserved much better.

Augy-Saint-Herem, 1 October 1944
