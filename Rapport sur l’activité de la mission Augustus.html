      <h2>Rapport de la fin tragique de la team Augustus</h2>
<br>
<p>

<h3>REPORT on the activity of Mission “AUGUSTUS”</h3>
<br><br>
This mission was composed of three men:
<br><br>
Indiana, American Major (Bonsall J.);
<br><br>
Hérault, French Captain (Delviche Jean);
<br><br>
Arizona, American radio NCO (Cote Roger).
<br><br>
They were parachuted during the night of 15–16 August 1944 on the field Fable, northwest of Colonfay (Aisne). The service message was “On the West, nothing new.” The operation appeared dangerous because German troops were present in the region, and patrols were being carried out by Georgians.
<br><br>
At 18:30, the service phrase was broadcast by the BBC. The regional head of Air Operations, Gramme (Jean-Pierre), and his assistant went to the command post near the drop site. The radio operator (Fontaine) was brought to check that all was in order. Moving through woods, quarries, bridges, and dangerous places, dedicated men were stationed to indicate the route and to warn of danger. Preparations completed, they returned to the PC and accelerated the final arrangements: assigning personnel who would attend the drop, verifying vehicles (two Citroën Traction and one Renault 1500-kg van).
<br><br>
At 19:30 and at 21:15, the phrase was repeated by the BBC. The operation would therefore take place that night. The regional team took the cars and departed for the parachute site. The trip went well, and around 22:00 everything was ready. The route was clear, the men were in position, and the reception team was ready. Markings were put in place immediately, for the night was dark, with poor conditions for parachuting men; tension was high.
<br><br>
Around 01:30, the welcome noise appeared, and the aircraft came. Excellent marking; after some maneuvers, the plane released containers and then the men, directly over the lights, so the “Augustins” landed in the center. After gathering and collecting material, first “Hérault” landed, then Major “Indiana,” then the radio “Arizona,” and the three men were together. They shook hands and embraced. All packages were found except one, which was recovered a few days later.
<br><br>
(page 2)
<br>
At 15 km from there, near Guise, they returned, all lights extinguished, sentries reassured, and everyone felt emotional and believed they were living a dream.
<br><br>
Then they arrived at the PC, where in the light we became better acquainted. Conversations and the joy of the mission, reception, champagne, and coffee with a splash of calvados from the finest year, and everyone went to bed as it was past 4:00 AM.
<br><br>
In the morning Fontanin, operator and liaison between Gramme and Ossorio, came to the PC of the latter to decide what destination would be given to the mission. It was decided they would begin operations in the region of Chaudun and would go by truck; all necessary measures were taken for the mission. That afternoon, a truck from Clairy (North) was put in place to take the mission to Clairy itself to explain the situation. Monsieur Arnolfo received them courteously. The “Augustins” were welcomed very sympathetically. They immediately established liaison. The mission remained at Clairy for the night.
<br><br>
The next day, the mission went to meet the Air Operations liaison officer, and they climbed to a real castle, Bonneudine (at London’s orders) and received the FFI of the region, and all were truly amazed at the work already done and the results obtained. They decided to install the mission in the south of the department around Soissons, where the Germans were riddled with panic. So the mission could act and, if necessary, send arms and messages to the Resistance in this sector.
<br><br>
Present: Gramme, Regional B.O.A, Moine, deputy to the regional; Bastien, Regional FFI; Renaud, Departmental representative, Aisne; Fontaine; Seigneur, operator A5.
<br><br>
On Saturday evening, Seigneur returned to Braine and announced to his men that an extremely discreet mission was to be installed as quickly as possible in the Soissons region. On Sunday morning, the three men composing the “Augustus” group were in the North of the department.
<br><br>
There was some hesitation about whether they should go lightly or in force. It was decided the convoy would depart Monday morning at daybreak. On Sunday, the mission visited the Soissons sector and, on Monday, the convoy went to Braine for the liberation of the Braine sector. The mission arrived at noon and the convoy set off.
<br><br>
(page 3)
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Seigneur, following Fortrer’s directions, went to Rugny, hamlet d’Acy-Ste-Restitue, to a member of the “Culotte” drop-zone team. Mahieu François agreed to host Seigneur, despite a large family, six young children, and especially the presence of a German detachment resting in the village for over a week.
<br><br>
Now we were ready for the journey.
<br><br>
Which route would we take?
<br><br>
Costeaux, who knows the region well, proposed the route to Soignour: Braine – Vailly-sur-Aisne (two bridges to cross, sometimes guarded) – le Chemin-des-Dames – Pinon and its works – Saint-Gobain and its ore depot – La Fère and its garrison and bridges – Vendeuil – Remontcourt – Bourbevoie. After discussion, Soignour accepted but insisted that the convoy take precautions in dangerous zones, especially since the region was full of Germans who had been resting for a week.
<br><br>
It was decided that two guard-posts would be placed the next day: Vailly-sur-Aisne and le Chemin-des-Dames, La Fère and Cornet d’Or – Homblières.
<br><br>
These posts were assured respectively by Jean Noël (bicycle), Jean Leroux, Jean Plantier, and Georges Fortier. One man was missing: J. Leroux.
<br><br>
Firsvt halt: leaving La Fère, Jean Plantier descended with his bicycle (the tire punctured for the good cause) because three G.M.R (police Pétain) were there, waiting for an opportunity near Saint-Quentin. They asked where we were going—“To Vendeuil,” replied Soignour.
<br><br>
Finding the road too short, they stayed in place. Costeaux refueled fully and we continued.
<br><br>
At Cornet-d’Or, no stop because one man was missing.
<br><br>
At Homblières, Fortier got off with his bicycle for the moment, R.A.S.
<br><br>
Third stop, near Remicourt, and we walked to Clamey.
<br><br>
We arrived at the home at 11:00. After some waiting, because an unknown car was parked, once it left, Seigneur and Fontaine returned to the mission and Costeaux prepared to unload and camouflage the radio equipment and camping gear.
<br><br>
(page 4)
<br><br>
Inside, the “Augustins” prepared their parcels and chose their identities. Seigneur, Fontaine, and Bastion finished the cards, and meanwhile the Captain went to Costeaux. The material was at the bottom, arms at hand, under a tarp, ready to move.
<br><br>
At 11:30, we set off, the Captain and the radio took the cabin with the driver, the Commander took a seat with Seigneur and Fontaine. At Remicourt, Fontaine got off.
<br><br>
Along the route each man learned his new identity by heart. In the cabin, the Captain asked the Sergeant:
<br><br>
– “What is your name?”
<br><br>
– “René Chabaud,” he replied, trying to roll his R’s.
<br><br>
– “Where were you born?”
<br><br>
– “United States,” he said.
<br><br>
– “But now, if you fell into the hands of the Gestapo, you would be shot immediately. Come on, where were you born?”
<br><br>
– “At Motorville, Basse-Seine.”
<br><br>
– “But not Basse-Seine; it is Seine-Inférieure, you were born at Saint-Quentin-Château, you are on holiday with me, your uncle.”
<br><br>
The Captain called himself “Jean Dorval,” resident of Coucy-le-Château, having left the previous day. You must therefore learn your own case; his alias was “Joseph Fortoval,” timber merchant at Anizy-le-Château.
<br><br>
Here Homblières; Fortier wrote R.A.S., but it was a busy point. I counted more than ten Gestapo cars; bicycles and sentries posted on the truck. They spoke of events in La Fère. Talking of vacationers, we were not very reassured, but after some details on life in France, they understood quickly or pretended to.
<br><br>
Crossing Vendeuil, we encountered a German convoy. One of the trucks forced us to climb onto the sidewalk at over 60 km/h; at 14:00 we avoided a serious accident. The convoy then left its route and stopped at La Fère. Plantier got out to speak to the Germans and climbed back inside.
<br><br>
After this episode:
<br><br>
– “Gasoline is more practical anyway.”
<br><br>
– “America has some and will bring some,” said Seigneur.
<br><br>
– “The war has created enormous gasoline shortages for these motorized machines.”
<br><br>
We set off again, met our comrade Jean Leroux, who left on a bicycle, and learned the reason for his delay.
<br><br>
“I managed to derail a freight train near the station at 11:00 backed by Mont-Notre-Dame. I returned very late at night.”
<br><br>
(page 5)
<br><br>
We were now five in the truck cabin, picking up the teams on the way, heading toward Braine.
<br><br>
Arriving a few kilometers from Pinon, we encountered Jean Noël, bicycle in hand, who informed us that one of the batteries had been found about 1 km outside the village and that it was blocking the road; but, he said, we could pass on the side.
<br><br>
At the exit of a bend, a “Panther” tank stopped, blocking the road; the truck slowed and was inspected by a German soldier. Our friends answered calmly. Our friends were thinking of firing, but we passed safely. At every obstacle, we brought our supplies back intact, all merchandise aboard us.
<br><br>
The journey ended well, but the convoy was in retreat. Braine was reached at 14:30. Everyone disembarked at Madame Costeaux, where we waited for a train in a basement pavillon with Lorraine colors. A late breakfast began and lasted until late afternoon. The Captain grew impatient to be recognized.
<br><br>
We stayed there until 20:00. After discussions with our hosts, we were led by car to Rugny, where we were joined with civilians. At 20:10, we arrived at Rugny, and the truck turned. The Captain had to climb out, because of mines along the route. We turned back to avoid the minefield, arriving again on the other side; this time the route was blocked by new obstacles. It rained.
<br><br>
Finally the road cleared and we arrived at 20:45 at Monsieur Mahieu’s in Rugny. We unloaded the parcels and put the truck under cover and stopped working. The Commander and the Captain shared messages with Jean Plantier; the radio, helped by Seigneur and Costeaux, installed and operated the new receiving post. It was impossible to intercept the broadcasts. The Captain was worried; the Commander decided to bring a new post the next day.
<br><br>
We dined with Mr. and Mrs. Mahieu and their children, who prepared a cordial reception. The mission was hosted for eight days.
<br><br>
(page 6) Work of the Mission
<br><br>
Most messages contained an urgent call for arms, and these messages underlined the importance of sending weapons as soon as possible to avoid shortages among the F.F.I. Cables contained reports on activity of the Germans; when necessary, these reports were sent to London. The train of convoys was in constant movement, and liaison with the F.F.I. was established in close collaboration with the B.O.A. The detailed plan of the fortified camp at Margival was sent to London by the field “Biscuit.” Another part of the plan concerning a port of the B.O.A. took the same route.
<br><br>
It was the Major and the Captain who decided on the cables to be sent; messages and receptions were sometimes very difficult for the Radio because the jamming was strong. He transmitted twice a day and especially at night as reception was better then. Jean Plantier helped Arizona in this work.
<br><br>
Indiana and Arizona moved very little, except on a few occasions to go to Seigneur’s PC, set up at Molitor, baker at Acy-Ste-Restitue. Liaison between the “Augustus” and the PC was carried out twice a day by Molto Gisèle, who passed on Allied visits and arrivals of men at the farm.
<br><br>
The Captain, on the other hand, made conferences on the role of the FFI.
<br><br>
(1) At the Artois farm, commune of Bouvarois, run by Mr. Georges Seigneur, the Captain met all chiefs of sectors from Château-Thierry to Dompierre, joined by two American visitors. They discussed the role of the FFI; the meeting lasted half a day.
<br><br>
(2) Later, the mission went to Rugny to meet the departmental FFI chief, Le Capitaine de Soissons (three visits).
<br><br>
(3) On August 26, the Captain sent Jean Plantier to Reims to contact “Oscar” concerning the “Tortue” plan. Hérault wanted to go himself, but the Radio told us that the Allies were advancing and he did not want to leave his comrades. The Captain decided to leave on Monday morning because Costeaux judged Sunday too dangerous; no vehicle was to leave on Sunday and all bridges were guarded. They were almost captured. The Captain drank with us and then returned to his shelter.
<br><br>
Sunday passed well while Seigneur and Costeaux searched for tobacco; mines were set off before 05:00 when they returned and they began digging. Seigneur and Jean decided to drop their arms at Acy; after dinner, they decided to go back at 21:00; they were delayed until 23:00; it was time to look for Fortier and Costeaux, who found only traces of mines and dug several. The Commander asked for an order for tubes. At 04:00 the SS raised all houses where numbers were noted. On departure halfway, an order for 4 tons had been stolen by another convoy.
<br><br>
Seigneur and Plantier could not return to Acy; more than 3,000 Germans were in the village. They returned only to prepare the convoy. They arrived at noon; more mines in the village; the Americans were 12 km away. It was time to leave.
<br><br>
(page 7)
<br><br>
At 14:00 the truck left; we arrived at Rugny, equipment stored, and we set off for Chauny. We made a detour to hide our arrival in Vaux. Upon arriving within 1 km, a German convoy was spotted on the horizon.
<br><br>
“What is that?” asked Fortier
<br><br>
“They are American tanks,” replied the Commander.
<br><br>
“Devil, they are firing, perhaps they will do the same to us?”
<br><br>
“Perhaps,” replied the Commander, “and they are aiming well.”
<br><br>
Arriving at Vaux, without incident, we ran to meet the liberating tanks, no longer concerned with the mines that still existed in the region.
<br><br>
The Commander and the Captain absolutely wanted to rejoin the lines or follow the tanks in retreat. After some hesitation, it was decided that Seigneur should leave the next morning with a patrol of four men; daylight would permit crossing the lines. That was preferable.
<br><br>
We returned to the home of Major Commander of the Colonin. We left our three friends who spoke with the American General, then the Captain left with us to return to Rugny with a patrol. Later, the three friends waited their return.
<br><br>
At 16:00 the Costeaux convoy left again for Soissons. At 16:00 the Captain came to pick us up at the Hôtel de la Croix d’Or, where we were lodged until the following day at 17:00.
<br><br>
The Allies were already in Laon; the mission went there in a Jeep and continued the trip in a tank.
<br><br>
The Captain knew the region well and was driven to Mr. Mahieu, farmer at Beony-Loizy, a few km north of Laon, and requested a car to cross the lines.
<br><br>
They left around 21:30 with a car abandoned by a German convoy earlier that day; M. Mahieu accompanied them to show the way. The Captain wanted to avoid the major roads. Around 22:00, they left alone; M. Mahieu returned home. The mission was to visit his brother-in-law at Frodomont. What happened next?
<br><br>
Around 22:15 the rain began, a torrential rain that reduced visibility to zero and made listening to suspicious noises difficult.
<br><br>
Arriving on the main road to Barenton-sur-Serre, they saw bodies without hats and crossed at an intersection of two roads. They stopped; a German car approached after the convoy and passed beside them. The car returned and stopped facing them. Shots were fired from the car. At 22:45 we learned from Mont-Notre-Dame that a battle had taken place here lasting more than two and a half hours. Five corpses were found, including that of the Commander, arms in the air. The Radio was lying two meters from the other side of the road, face down, and arms twisted (he had probably tried to escape).
<br><br>
They all had severe head wounds.
<br><br>
The tanks departed around 23:15.
<br><br>
(page 8 – conclusion)
<br><br>
According to information gathered near the site, they were disarmed and searched, but not thoroughly, for their identity cards, some objects, and their wallets were still on them. In the car, found at Mortiers, nothing remained.
<br><br>
It is by pure chance and thanks to Mr. Mahieu—who informed Lieutenant Seigneur—that we were able to find the trace of Mission “Augustus.”
<br><br>
All three rest in the little cemetery of Barenton-sur-Serre (Aisne).
