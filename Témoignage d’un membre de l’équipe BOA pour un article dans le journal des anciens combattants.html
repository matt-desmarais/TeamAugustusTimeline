MISSION "AUGUSTUS" (Pages 114-117)
<br><br>
This mission was composed of 3 men:
<br><br>
- "Indiana", American Major (J. Bonsal);
<br><br>
- "Herault", French Captain (Jean Delviche);
<br><br>
- "Arizona", American Staff-Sergeant / Radio operator (Roger Cote).
<br><br>
They were parachuted during the night of August 15-16, 1944, northwest of Colonfay, on the field "Fable", within the area of Group "C" placed under the authority of Captain "Richard" (Jean Merlin), in a property belonging to Pierre Fiabat. The message stated: "To the West, nothing new."
<br><br>
At that time, German troops stationed in the region. A section of Terrible Georgians patrolled day and night. Great precautions were therefore needed to carry out a parachute drop.
<br><br>
Thus, on August 15, at 13:30, the BBC broadcast the expected message.
<br><br>
Jean-Pierre, Regional Chief of the B.O.A., and his assistant went to the P.C. near the drop site, at the Balingard family farm, about 30 km from the drop. The radio operator immediately set out to scout the route. At a crossroad, they met Raymond, assistant to Captain Richard, who returned from reconnaissance. He confirmed the Germans were less numerous, but he had been fired on by machine-guns after the Maquis attack at "Le Camp des Mille", on July 7, 1944, during a large-scale Maquis operation.
<br><br>
With Raymond, he was convinced the drop could be carried out. The path to the drop zone was secured but needed to be strengthened. The paratroopers only had their personal weapons.
<br><br>
Raymond therefore turned back, and directed the lights necessary for marking the drop field.
<br><br>
So "Herault", "Indiana", and the radio "Arizona" joined the reception team. They entrusted their parachutes to the "Sanglier" team (Marcel Boutantin), who were responsible for gathering the containers delivered after the parachute jumps. Two 1,500 kg Renault trucks, led by Jean-Pierre's team, with two more vehicles (2 Citroen Traction), were assigned to each.
<br><br>
One container was missing and would only be found four days later near Guise, 15 km from the drop zone, close to the Sanglier farm, which had seen a German vehicle pass.
<br><br>
Around 1:30 am, a sympathetic sound of an aircraft was heard, appearing only moments later. After some maneuvers to face the wind, as the beacon indicated, the aircraft first dropped its containers and then, calmly, the men. But one burst of wind, or a mistake by the pilot, caused the Augustuses to land at a good distance from the rectangle of the drop zone.
<br><br>
A few seconds after the parachutists landed, helmeted lights from the reception team gathered them. "Herault" (Captain Delviche) arrived first. Then "Indiana". Finally, the radio "Arizona" joined them.
<br><br>
Page 115 (continued)
<br><br>
On the morning of August 16, "Fontaine" (Edmond Bricout, responsible for Group "A") presented himself at the P.C. He had been previously charged with finding shelter and indicated that the farm where they were, near Beaurvoir (Aisne), could host the three men, who were welcomed immediately. On the evening of the 19th, however, they only stayed 24 hours.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Jean-Pierre helped move them to Clary (Nord), about twelve kilometers from Cateau, in Michel Cornaille's house, where they were warmly received. They stayed until August 20, at noon.
<br><br>
On August 17, to return "Seigneur", who was to head to London, Captain "Herault" and radio "Arizona" went south of the drop zone towards Soissons, under the authority of "Seigneur" (Lieutenant Dodard), responsible for the region. On the 21st, "Seigneur" traveled by car, and took charge in Soissons.
<br><br>
On the 22nd, "Seigneur" left Bramlie and from the 22nd to 30th, he was responsible for transmitting new lamps for the reception operations. He returned to Clary and linked with the Augustuses at once.
<br><br>
Pages 116-117
<br><br>
After several days, and despite great difficulties, mechanic Maurice Moreau managed to restore the vehicle. He would fall facing the enemy a few days later, on Monday August 28, fighting at the Pont de Braine.
<br><br>
The itinerary via Vailly-sur-Aisne, La Fere, Hombliere and Beaurvoir was marked by 3 cyclists: Jean Leroux, Emile Fortier and Jean Plantier.
<br><br>
The truck arrived at Clary at 11 o'clock. Half an hour later, Captain Delviche and radio "Arizona" climbed into the cabin. Major American "Seigneur" sat on rabbit skins on which were placed dangerous equipment: radio transmitters, weapons, and ammunition.
<br><br>
During the journey, each man memorized his cover identity. A few kilometers from Pinon, one man signaled "enemy post ahead." The truck slowed near a village, about 1 km away. The Germans, at the foot of the village, saw them but did not take notice. At the height of the slope, after avoiding another hostile position, they continued.
<br><br>
On August 20, at 14:30, they stopped at Mme Costeaux's home, whose husband was in retirement. Then at 17:00 they reached the Pont de Braine, moving toward the house of Mr. L. Mme Magniez hosted the Mission. The Mission stayed five days.
<br><br>
And for six days, radio "Arizona," helped by Jean Plantier, exchanged for 24 hours with London, who informed him on German forces as well as the best routes and targets for bombing.
<br><br>
Between P.C. of "Seigneur," the house of Mme Mollier, baker at Arcy, and Mission Augustus, the link was ensured by Mlle Motsch.
<br><br>
On Monday August 28, Emile Fortier rejoined the Augustuses, who decided to meet the Allies.
<br><br>
Around 14:00, the truck driven by Raymond left with the Mission, accompanied by Seigneur and Jean Plantier. A few kilometers from Rigny, a column of German armored cars with heavy machine guns disembarked passengers and surrounded the officer, giving orders. German tanks were seen and the Augustuses were asked to follow the retreating Germans.
<br><br>
On August 30, around 22:45, less than an hour after the Mission's departure, gunfire was heard in Barenton-sur-Serre, and the bodies of three men including the radio operator were found the next morning, horribly mutilated by the Germans. Thus, they would have been better placed for the Allies had they stayed at their transmission post.
<br><br>
Captain Delviche, who knew the region, was led on Wednesday August 30, to Mr. Magniez, farmer at Besny-Loizy, north of Laon, with his two comrades and their equipment in retreat. A vehicle drawn by a horse was loaded during the day by the Germans in retreat.
<br><br>
Around 22:00 the Augustuses seized the vehicle and set off to Froidmont, via Barenton-Cel and Barenton-sur-Serre, at Mr Magniez's brother-in-law's home, where they never arrived. It was very dark and raining heavily.
<br><br>
What happened?
<br><br>
The inhabitants reported hearing shots around 22:45, less than an hour after the Mission's departure. They later found the bodies in a small cemetery in Barenton-sur-Serre, horribly mutilated.
<br><br>
The parachute team of the "Fable" field (Sector of Sains-Richaumont):

Chief of Sector: Lieutenant Boutantin, nicknamed "Sanglier", who succeeded Jean Susini, killed in operation.
